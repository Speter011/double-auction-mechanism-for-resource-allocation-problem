# Resource allocation in edge computing

A double auction solution for resource allocation in edge computing. The agents are the sellers: `servers` which provide resources; and buyers: `devices`, such as computers which buy the resources. The buyers can bid on the available resources,
which are `RAM capacity`, `CPU capacity` and `bandwidth`. The winner of the auction is determined by a double auction mechanism provided by the `auctioneer` agent.
